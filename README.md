# ü•¶ Post-Harvest-Spoilage-Analysis in Agriculture

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing post-harvest spoilage and revenue loss in the agricultural sector. The goal of the analysis is to uncover key insights that can help stakeholders reduce losses and improve food security by leveraging data.

## üìä Project Objective

To understand the scale and patterns of post-harvest spoilage and revenue loss across different conditions ‚Äî such as technology used, access to markets, and crop type ‚Äî and to generate actionable insights for stakeholders.

## ‚úÖ Key KPIs
 
- **Total Revenue Loss**: _‚Ç¶41 million_  
- **Highest Spoilage Crop**: _Maize (34k units)_  
- **Lowest Spoilage Crop**: _Tomato_  
- **Revenue Loss by Access to Market**:
  - Poor Access: ‚Ç¶8M
  - Moderate Access: ‚Ç¶21M
  - Good Access: ‚Ç¶12M  
- **Revenue Loss by Technology Used**:
  - No Technology: ‚Ç¶25M
  - Solar Dryer: ‚Ç¶6M
  - Mobile App: ‚Ç¶6M
  - Hermetic Bags: ‚Ç¶4M

## üìà Dashboard Visuals

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. **Spoilage Amount by Crop Type**  
   _A bar chart showing spoilage distribution across crops._

2. **Revenue Loss by Access to Market**  
   _Clustered column chart displaying how market access affects revenue loss._

3. **Revenue Loss by Technology Used**  
   _Bar chart showing how adoption of post-harvest technologies helps reduce losses._

4. **Spoilage vs Transport Distance (Scatter Plot)**  
   _Investigates if transport distance influences spoilage volume._

5. **Youth vs Non-Youth Revenue Loss**  
   _Compares post-harvest loss between youth-led and non-youth-led agribusinesses._

## üß™ Hypotheses Tested

- Poor access to markets leads to higher revenue loss.
- Transport distance is positively correlated with spoilage.
- Use of post-harvest technologies significantly reduces revenue loss.
- Non-tech users suffer more losses than tech users.
- Youth-led agribusinesses experience less spoilage than non-youth.

## üß† Key Insights

- **Market access is a major driver** of revenue loss. Moderate access surprisingly recorded the highest loss indicating a possible inefficiency in distribution or handling. 
- **Technology usage** plays a critical role: Those who didn‚Äôt use any preservation tech lost significantly more than those who used solar dryers, hermetic bags, or mobile apps.
- **Transport distance** had mixed effects on spoilage, suggesting external factors like road quality or storage conditions may also be involved.
- **Maize** accounted for the highest spoilage volume, pointing to the need for better handling and drying mechanisms.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Power BI** ‚Äì Data modeling, DAX, and interactive dashboard creation  
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Initial data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Project version control and portfolio showcase

## üßë‚Äçüíº Target Audience

This project is particularly valuable for:

- Agricultural stakeholders and NGOs
- Government policymakers
- AgriTech startups
- Data-driven supply chain analysts

## üìç Conclusion

The insights derived from this dashboard provide strong evidence to push for investment in post-harvest technologies and improved market infrastructure. This work contributes toward minimizing food loss and enhancing profitability for smallholder farmers.
